Loan Prediction Model


"You really impressed the management of European Bank with the last deliverable, and they have now requested you to assist further with analyzing their loans data. We have dealt with European Bank before, but as a recap, they connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Now bank would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying back."
For this project we will be using publicly available data from LendingClub(2007-2010) and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. Bank is looking for a model that will help to predict this.
